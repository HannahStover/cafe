# cafe
To start the website, download and then cd into the cafe folder. Start by deleting the dist folder, package.json and package-lock.json. In the terminal, run 'npm init' and initialize a package.json with the entry point 'index.js'. This will create your own package.json file.  Run 'npm i --save-dev webpack' and then 'npm i --save-dev webpack-cli'. Replace the contents of your new local package.json with the contents of the package.json I have uploaded on github. At this point, you can run 'npm run dev' and then 'npm start'. It will give you console output about chunks being emitted and starting up on the local server, you can go to that address in your browser and see the website. This will create a dist folder; it is just minifed output of all files. If you are making changes and don't see it updating, to kill the server you can run ctrl+c in the terminal window, then deleting the dist folder and running 'npm run dev' and 'npm start' again will update any changes. 

The file structure is important here- changing the file structure in any way will break the website.
