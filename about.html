                <p class='feature-content p'><br>Café Presse and Le Pichet owners Jim Drohman and Joanne Herron have
                    both
                    long been fascinated by the food, wine and lifestyle of France. Jim and Joanne opened Le Pichet in
                    2000, emulating a personal, neighborhood feel. <br><br>
                    With Café Presse, Jim and Joanne hope to build type of Parisian institution, a Bar/Café.
                    Café Presse is your alternative
                    living room. <br><br> One can enjoy coffee and croissants in the morning, meet friends for lunch,
                    dinner or
                    drinks
                    throughout the day or to have a late night bite or a night cap until 2am.

            <h4 class='title'> Co-Owner | Joanne Herron</h4>
            <p>Joanne has worked in the service industry since 1981, including over 12
                years at Market Place Caterers/The RUINS. Her interest in France began with her
                first visit
                to the French countryside at age 19 and has grown through many professional and
                personal
                visits. She has spent extensive time touring the wine producing regions of
                France, learning
                firsthand from winemakers and importers and has participated in the “vendage” or
                harvest of
                grapes in the Loire Valley.</p>

            <h4 class='title'>Co-Owner | Jim Drohman</h4>
            <p>Jim left a career as an
                Aeronautical Engineer to train in the cuisine at l’Ecole Superior de Cuisine
                Jean Ferrandi
                in Paris. During his stay in France, he worked at several restaurants, including
                Le Boudin
                Sauvage and the Michelin rated Le Coq de la Maison Blanche. In 1991, he returned
                to Seattle

            <p>James got his start in the world of corporate restaurants in Florida, before
                getting his first opportunity to work in a high quality kitchen at Orlando’s
                Boat House Restaurant. Attracted by Seattle’s fantastic farm-to-table produce,
                James switched coasts in 2010 and worked under chef Matt Janke at Lecosho and
                chef Walter Pisano at Tulio. These experiences inspired him to seek a formal
                culinary education at the Culinary Academy at Seattle Central College. He joined
                the kitchen at Le Pichet in 2014 and earned the position of Sous Chef at Café
