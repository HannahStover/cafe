                            years at Market Place Caterers/The RUINS. Her interest in France began with her
                            first visit
                            to the French countryside at age 19 and has grown through many professional and

                            visits. She has spent extensive time touring the wine producing regions of
                            France, learning
                            firsthand from winemakers and importers and has participated in the “vendage” or
                            harvest of

                        <h4>Chef de Cuisine | James O'Hern</h4>
                        <p>James got his start in the world of corporate restaurants in Florida, before
                            getting his first opportunity to work in a high quality kitchen at Orlando’s
                            Boat House Restaurant. Attracted by Seattle’s fantastic farm-to-table produce,
                            James switched coasts in 2010 and worked under chef Matt Janke at Lecosho and
                            chef Walter Pisano at Tulio. These experiences inspired him to seek a formal
                            culinary education at the Culinary Academy at Seattle Central College. He joined
                            the kitchen at Le Pichet in 2014 and earned the position of Sous Chef at Café
                            Presse in 2015. In 2017, he was promoted to Chef de Cuisine of Café Presse.</p>
